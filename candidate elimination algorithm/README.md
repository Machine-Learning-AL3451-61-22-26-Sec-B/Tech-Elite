Concept Learning Algorithm using "CANDIDATE ELIMINATION ALGORITHM"

This Python script implements a basic version of the concept learning algorithm using the Candidate Elimination algorithm. It takes a dataset in CSV format, where each row represents an instance of a concept, and the last column represents the target concept (either "yes" or "no"). The algorithm then generates the most specific and general hypotheses based on the provided data.

Installation
To run the script, you need Python installed on
your system along with the following dependencies:
-numpy
-pandas

You can install these dependencies using pip:
"pip install numpy pandas"

Usage:

Dataset Preparation: 
Prepare your dataset in CSV format. The last column should represent the target concept, and the preceding columns should represent the attributes or features of the concepts.

Run the Script: 
Execute the Python script (app.py) and provide the path to your dataset as an argument:

   "python app.py,CED.csv"
View Results: 
The script will display the initialization of specific and general hypotheses, followed by the iteration steps of the algorithm. Finally, it will print the final specific and general hypotheses.

Algorithm Overview:
The concept learning algorithm implemented in this script follows these steps:

1.Initialize the specific hypothesis with the first instance in the dataset.
2.Initialize the general hypothesis with all attributes set to "?".
3.Iterate through each instance in the dataset:
  3.1 If the target concept is "yes", update the specific and general hypotheses accordingly.
  3.2 If the target concept is "no", update the general hypothesis accordingly.
4.Remove any redundant hypotheses from the final general hypothesis.

Example:
Suppose we have a dataset (CED.csv) with instances of concepts and their corresponding target concepts. After running the script with this dataset, it will output the final specific and general hypotheses.
