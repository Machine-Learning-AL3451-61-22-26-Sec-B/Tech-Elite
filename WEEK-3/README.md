# Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Backpropagation algorithm. The ANN is trained and tested using appropriate datasets to demonstrate its functionality.

## Overview

An Artificial Neural Network (ANN) is a computational model inspired by the biological neural networks of the human brain. The Backpropagation algorithm is a supervised learning technique used to train neural networks by adjusting the weights to minimize the error between predicted and actual outputs.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy: pip install numpy
- Matplotlib (for visualization): pip install matplotlib
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided example notebook): pip install jupyter

## Files

- neural_network.py: Contains the implementation of the ANN with Backpropagation.
- datasets/: Directory containing the datasets used for training and testing.
- examples/: Directory containing example usage of the neural network.
- README.md: This file providing an overview of the project.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/artificial-neural-network-backpropagation.git
   

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   bash
   cd artificial-neural-network-backpropagation
   

3. Install the required dependencies:

   bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   

4. Run the provided examples or create your own:

   bash
   python examples/train_and_test.py
   

## Example

An example notebook (examples/ANN_Backpropagation_Example.ipynb) is provided to demonstrate how to train and test the neural network using sample datasets. You can run the notebook in Jupyter for a step-by-step guide.
