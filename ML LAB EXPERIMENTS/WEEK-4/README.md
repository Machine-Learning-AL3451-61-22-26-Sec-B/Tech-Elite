Sure, here's a README file for your Naive Bayes Classifier Streamlit app:

---

# Naive Bayes Classifier

## Overview

This is a simple Streamlit web application for training and testing a Naive Bayes classifier on a dataset provided by the user via CSV file upload. The app preprocesses the data, trains the classifier, and then tests it to compute accuracy.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Streamlit
- pandas
- scikit-learn

You can install the required Python packages via pip:

```bash
pip install streamlit pandas scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository or download the `main.py` file.

2. Install the required Python packages as mentioned above.

3. Run the Streamlit app using the following command:

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

4. Once the app is running, you will see a file uploader prompting you to upload your training data CSV file.

5. Upload your CSV file containing your training data. Make sure the target variable is in the last column.

6. The app will preprocess the data, train the Naive Bayes classifier, test it, and display the accuracy.
