# Artificial Neural Network with Backpropagation

This project implements an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using the Backpropagation algorithm.

## Overview

An ANN is a computational model inspired by the human brain's neural networks. Backpropagation is a supervised learning technique used to train neural networks by adjusting weights to minimize prediction errors.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (for visualization)
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running examples)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/artificial-neural-network-backpropagation.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```
   cd artificial-neural-network-backpropagation
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run examples:

   ```
   python examples/train_and_test.py
   ```

## Example

An example notebook (examples/ANN_Backpropagation_Example.ipynb) demonstrates training and testing the neural network using sample datasets.
